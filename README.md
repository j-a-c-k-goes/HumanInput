# HumanInput

## Context
Processing experiment on basic keyboard and mouse input and responsiveness. However, sketch grew into a clock; many of the sketch's parameters and expressions are bound to the machine's time ( hours, minutes, seconds). I am currently using this as a desk clock, and thinking of creating a watch face in the future. 

## Installation
Included are builds for MacOS, Windows, and Linux. Each is located in its respective folder within the repository.

_Note: if running on Mac, you probably need OpenJDK ( the Java is not currently embedded for size purposes)._

[Install JDK](https://openjdk.org/install/)
